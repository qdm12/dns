# DNS over TLS upstream server Docker container

DNS over TLS upstream server connected to DNS over TLS (IPv4 and IPv6) servers with DNSSEC, DNS rebinding protection, built-in Docker healthcheck and fine grain IPs + hostnames blocking

**Announcement**: *The `:latest` image is now based on v2 which is a pure Go implementation for a DNS server connecting over DoT and DoH with a bunch of features.*

**The `:latest` Docker image breaks compatibility with previous images based on v1.x.x versions**

Diagrams are shown for router and client-by-client configurations in the [**Connect clients to it**](#connect-clients-to-it) section.

### Roadmap

1. DNSSEC validation
2. Custom redirection from hostname to IP address

## Setup

1. Launch the container with

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp qmcgaw/dns
    ```

    You can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    More environment variables are described in the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

    The image is also available at `ghcr.io/qdm12/dns`.
1. See the [Connect clients to it](#connect-clients-to-it) section, you can also refer to the [Verify DNS connection](#verify-dns-connection) section if you want.

〽️ [Metrics setup](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/v2.0.0-beta/readme/metrics)

If you run an old Docker version or Kernel, you might want to run the container as root with `--user="0"` (see [this issue](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/issues/79) for context).

If you're running Kubernetes, there is a separate article on [how to set up K8s](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/v2.0.0-beta/KUBERNETES.md).

## Migrate

The `v2` version of the image (starting with `v2.0.0`) is a DNS server connecting to authoritative nameservers over TLS or HTTPS, and completely written from scratch in Go.

There are several changes between the `v1` images and `v2`:

- The following environment variables are now deprecated: `LISTENINGPORT`, `PROVIDERS`, `PROVIDER`, `CACHING`, `IPV4`, `IPV6`, `UNBLOCK`, `PRIVATE_ADDRESS`, `CHECK_UNBOUND`, `VERBOSITY`, `VERBOSITY_DETAILS`, `VALIDATION_LOGLEVEL`. You will receive a warning log with how to replace it, if you set them when running the v2.x.x image (or `:latest`).
- You can no longer bind mount an Unbound configuration file

## Golang API

If you want to use the Go code I wrote, you can see tiny [examples](examples) of DoT and DoH resolvers and servers using the API developed.

## Connect clients to it

### Option 1: Router (recommended)

All machines connected to your router will use the 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS by default

Configure your router to use the LAN IP address of your Docker host as its primary DNS address.

- Access your router page, usually at [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) and login with your credentials
- Change the DNS settings, which are usually located in *Connection settings / Advanced / DNS server*
- If a secondary fallback DNS address is required, use a dull ip address such as the router's IP 192.168.1.1 to force traffic to only go through this container

![Diagram router](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-router.png?raw=true)

To ensure network clients cannot use another DNS, you might want to

- Block the outbound UDP 53 port on your router firewall
- Block the outbound TCP 853 port on your router firewall, **except from your Docker host**
- If you have *Deep packet inspection* on your router, block DNS over HTTPs on port TCP 443

### Option 2: Client, one by one

You have to configure each machine connected to your router to use the Docker host as their DNS server.

![Diagram clients](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-clients.png?raw=true)

#### Docker containers

Connect other Docker containers by specifying the DNS to be the host IP address `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --dns=127.0.0.1 alpine
```

For *docker-compose.yml*:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    image: alpine:3.11
    network_mode: bridge
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1
```

If the containers are in the same Docker network, you can simply set the `dns` to the LAN IP address of the DNS container (i.e. `10.0.0.5`)

#### Windows

1. Open the control panel and follow the instructions shown on the screenshots below.

![Windows screenshot 1](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows1.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 2](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows2.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 3](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows3.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 4](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows4.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 5](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows5.png?raw=true)

Enter the IP Address of your Docker host as the **Preferred DNS server** (`192.168.1.210` in my case)
You can set the Cloudflare DNS server address 1.1.1.1 as an alternate DNS server although you might want to
leave this blank so that no domain name request is in plaintext.

![Windows screenshot 6](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows6.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 7](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows7.png?raw=true)

When closing, Windows should try to identify any potential problems.
If everything is fine, you should see the following message:

![Windows screenshot 8](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows8.png?raw=true)

#### Mac OS

Follow the instructions at [https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577)

#### Linux

You probably know how to do that. Otherwise you can usually modify the first line of */etc/resolv.conf* by changing the IP address of your DNS server.

#### Android

See [this](http://xslab.com/2013/08/how-to-change-dns-settings-on-android/)

#### iOS

See [this](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/558)

### Firewall considerations

This container requires the following connections:

- UDP 53 Inbound (only if used externally)
- TCP 853 Outbound to 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1

### Verify DNS connection

1. Verify that you use Cloudflare DNS servers: [https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com) with the Standard or Extended test
1. Verify that DNS SEC is enabled: [https://en.internet.nl/connection](https://en.internet.nl/connection)

Note that [https://1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) does not work as the container is not a client to Cloudflare servers but a forwarder intermediary. Hence [https://1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) does not detect a direct connection to them.

## Go API

Some packages are exposed publicly through the [pkg](pkg) directory.

- The current API is at v2.x.x and is meant to be (mostly) stable and should not introduce breaking changes.
- The API at v1.x.x was (shame on me) unstable and there were many breaking changes between feature versions.

For now, it is used by the [gluetun](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) project for its DNS over TLS usage.
