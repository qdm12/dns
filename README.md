# DNS over TLS or HTTPs forwarding resolver

Resolver communicating with public DNS recursive servers over encrypted channels with TLS or HTTPs.
It also does **caching**, **filtering**, **split-horizon DNS**, **IPv6**, **Prometheus metrucs**.
It's fully coded in Go and is a single and cross platform binary program.

**Announcement**: *I am currently working on a DNSSEC validator implementation to reach feature parity with the v1.x.x image using Unbound*

**The `:v2.0.0-beta` Docker image breaks compatibility with previous images based on v1.x.x versions**

Diagrams are shown for router and client-by-client configurations in the [**Connect clients to it**](#connect-clients-to-it) section.

## Setup

### Container setup

```sh
docker run -d -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp qmcgaw/dns:v2.0.0-beta
```

You can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/v2.0.0-beta/docker-compose.yml) with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

The image is also available as `ghcr.io/qdm12/dns:v2.0.0-beta`.

If you run an old Docker version or Kernel, you might want to run the container as root with `--user="0"` (see [this issue](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/issues/79) for context).

### Binary program setup

üöß **waiting for release v2.0.0**

Download the prebuilt binary for your platform from the **Assets** section of the last release on the [releases page](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/releases).

If you run on Linux or OSX, make sure to make it executable with `chmod +x dns`.

You can then run it by clicking on it or in your terminal with `./dns`.

### Kubernetes setup

See the [KUBERNETES.md document](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/v2.0.0-beta/KUBERNETES.md).

## Migrate

The `v2.x.x` version of the image (starting with `v2.0.0-beta`) is a complete rewrite from scratch in Go.

There are several non-compatible changes between the `v1` and `v2` images:

- The following environment variables are now unused: `PRIVATE_ADDRESS`, `IPV4`, `IPV6`. The program logs an explanation if any of these is set when running a v2.x.x image.
- The following environment variables are now replaced: `LISTENINGPORT`, `PROVIDERS`, `PROVIDER`, `CACHING`, `UNBLOCK`, `CHECK_UNBOUND`, `VERBOSITY`, `VERBOSITY_DETAILS`, `VALIDATION_LOGLEVEL`. The program logs an explanation if any of these is set when running a v2.x.x image.
- You can no longer bind mount an Unbound configuration file
- Caching is enabled by default (in memory LRU cache with up to 10,000 items)

## Golang API

If you want to use the Go code, you can see tiny [examples](examples) of DoT and DoH resolvers and servers using the API developed. You can also implement your interfaces to pass as settings to existing constructors to further customize the behavior of the program.

The Go API exposed to the public (`pkg/` directory) will stay **stable and compatible** for a long time and there is no reason so far to change it.

## Connect clients to it

### Option 1: Router (recommended)

All machines connected to your router will use the DNS server container by default.

Configure your router to use the LAN IP address of your Docker host as its primary DNS address.

- Access your router page, usually at [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) and login with your credentials
- Change the DNS settings, which are usually located in *Connection settings / Advanced / DNS server*
- If a secondary fallback DNS address is required, use a dull ip address such as the router's IP 192.168.1.1 to force traffic to only go through this container

![Diagram router](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-router.png?raw=true)

To ensure network clients cannot use another DNS, you might want to

- Block the outbound UDP 53 port on your router firewall
- Block the outbound TCP 53 port on your router firewall
- Block the outbound TCP 853 port on your router firewall, **except from your Docker host**
- If you have *Deep packet inspection* on your router, block DNS over HTTPs on port TCP 443

### Option 2: Client, one by one

You have to configure each machine connected to your router to use the Docker host as their DNS server.

![Diagram clients](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/diagram-clients.png?raw=true)

#### Docker containers

Connect other Docker containers by specifying the DNS to be the host IP address `127.0.0.1`:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --dns=127.0.0.1 alpine
```

For *docker-compose.yml*:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  test:
    image: alpine
    network_mode: bridge
    dns:
      - 127.0.0.1
```

If the containers are in the same Docker network, you can simply set the `dns` to the LAN IP address of the DNS container (i.e. `10.0.0.5`)

#### Windows

1. Open the control panel and follow the instructions shown on the screenshots below.

![Windows screenshot 1](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows1.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 2](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows2.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 3](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows3.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 4](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows4.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 5](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows5.png?raw=true)

Enter the IP Address of your Docker host as the **Preferred DNS server** (`192.168.1.210` in my case)
You can set the Cloudflare DNS server address 1.1.1.1 as an alternate DNS server although you might want to
leave this blank so that no domain name request is in plaintext.

![Windows screenshot 6](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows6.png?raw=true)

![Windows screenshot 7](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows7.png?raw=true)

When closing, Windows should try to identify any potential problems.
If everything is fine, you should see the following message:

![Windows screenshot 8](https://github.com/qdm12/dns/blob/master/readme/windows8.png?raw=true)

#### Mac OS

Follow the instructions at [https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25577)

#### Linux

You probably know how to do that. Otherwise you can usually modify the first line of */etc/resolv.conf* by changing the IP address of your DNS server.

#### Android

See [this](http://xslab.com/2013/08/how-to-change-dns-settings-on-android/)

#### iOS

See [this](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/558)

### Verify DNS connection

1. Verify that you use Cloudflare DNS servers: [https://www.dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com) with the Standard or Extended test
1. Verify that DNS SEC is enabled: [https://en.internet.nl/connection](https://en.internet.nl/connection)

Note that [https://1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) does not work as the container is not a client to Cloudflare servers but a forwarder intermediary. Hence [https://1.1.1.1/help](https://1.1.1.1/help) does not detect a direct connection to them.
